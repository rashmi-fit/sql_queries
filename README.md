# sql practice
This repositories will have all the practice sql queries from leetcode

# Day1:
All the dopemine hits and i feel really motivated to work on this.

# Day2:
Understood the nuances of GROUP BY and aggregate functions like COUNT reinforces the importance of clear data organization.
These  are not just about solving problems—they’re about uncovering patterns and telling stories hidden in data. I felt it was tough for me but learnt out of it and took a lot of time to solve it.

# Day3:
This was easy and i understood how to get insights using having clause. I have used cte intentionally so that its modular in structure
- Organized SQL logic clearly.
- Applied grouping and filtering techniques effectively.
- Used joins to connect filtered subsets with broader datasets.

# Day4:

I was bit inconsistent and didnt work for continous 3 days. But i am back and started solving which i am greatful.

Today i solved learnt Percentage of Users Attended a Contest
- break the problem in smaller steps to solve
- TotalUsers acts as a foundation like knowing the total number of people in a room
- ContestRegistrations focuses on specific groups because it helps in counting how many people are in each team
- Used round function and order by to get the result

# Day5:

- Used DATE_SUB (or similar functions) to compute dynamic date ranges instead of hardcoding start and end dates.
- The BETWEEN clause helps cleanly filter rows within a range.

# Day6:

- Its pretty easy today where it involves filtering conditions and the ordering (which is descending in this case)
- Figuring out the odd numbered ID gives the movies which were not "boring"
